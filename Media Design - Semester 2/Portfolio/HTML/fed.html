            <p>
                Front-end development is a the subject that focuses on designing and implementing user interfaces for
                websites and applications. We will learn how to create interactive and responsive user interfaces using
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                We will also learn about design principles, accessibility, and user testing.

                        worked with Flex and Grid,
                        and I researched how to use them properly before applying this new knowledge when creating

                        During this task I was able to revise my knowledge of HTML and CSS as well as to learn new
                        things like aligning items at the center of the navigation bar, work with videos in CSS and HTML
                        and adding shadows to the elements. I also learned about Flex and gain more experience in
                        working with Grid and how to create different layouts.
                        At the end of the day I showed my work to the teacher and he was satisfied with the end result
                        as I didn't have that much experience in HTML and CSS.

                        I researched how to connect the Javascript to the index page, how to create EventListeners, and

                        worked with Flex and Grid,
                        and I researched how to use them properly before applying this new knowledge when creating

                        and adding shadows to the elements. I also learned about Flex and gain more experience in

                    <h2>What I Made</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        For the first part of the assignment I created a simple html page displaying the names and
                        pictures of my group members. I didn't focus on the page's style as my main priority was to make
                        the fetching from the JSON file work. For the second task I chose to work with NumbersAPI
                        (<span><a href="http://numbersapi.com/#42">http://numbersapi.com/#42</a></span>) This is an API
                        that shows a random fact about the number that the user has entered.</p>
                    <h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        With this task I learned how to fetch information from a JSON file as well as what an API is and
                        how to work with it.
