            <p> User-centered design is the subject that focuses on creating products, systems, and services with the
                user's
                needs and preferences in mind. Students learn how to conduct user research, develop personas, and create
                prototypes that prioritize user experience and satisfaction.
                Students learn how to apply user-centered design principles to real-world design problems through
                hands-on
                projects.</p>

                        I decided to create a presentation for this assignment. I started of by writing 1-2 sentences
                        about my future in the UCD field. After that I conducted a small analysis of various websites
                        and found three well-desgined websites and 3 not so well designed websites.
                        Then I added them to the presentation with short supporting arguments for each website.</p>

                        Firstly I conducted a research to learn about positioning as a business strategy. Following that
                        I did another research this time focusing on Coca-Cola and how they have positioned themselves
                        on the market as well as how this has contributed them to the brand's global success</p>

                        While working on this assignment I learned what segmentation, targeting and positioning mean and

                        Coca-cola target their clients and what methods they use to position the brand in the customer's
                        "eyes".
                        In addition I learned how and where to find initial data about users for my future work and

                        clear and practical examples for each of the principles. At end I combined everything in a small
                        presentation with short information about each example.</p>

                        During this task I was able to revise my knowledge of HTML and CSS as well as to learn new

                        and adding shadows to the elements. I also learned about Flex and gain more experience in
                        working with Grid and how to create different layouts.
                        At the end of the day I showed my work to the teacher and he was satisfied with the end result
                        as I didn't have that much experience in HTML and CSS.

                        the interview, we carefully analyzed the information gathered and used it to populate the four
                        parts of our empathy map - "Says", "Thinks", "Feels", "Does". In "Says" we documented statements
                        and quotes from the client. In "Thinks" we wrote down his assumptions and beliefs. In "Feels" we
                        captured the client's emotion state, while the "Does" part documented his actions and behavior.
