                    My mother signed me up in one of the best software academies in the country in fifth grade after
                    noticing my strong interest in computers. I continued to attend those classes until seventh
                    grade when it came time to choose a high school. I applied to a prestigious school with foreign
                    languages, mathematics, and informatics because I was still interested in programming. Five years
                    later, I pursued my ICT studies at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

                    Along with my education, I was taking Taekwondo classes where I developed my skills in this art to a
                    very high level. I
                    was also a member of a dance crew, with whom I was able to participate in a variety of events and
                    competitions.

                        <p>In my spare time, you can usually find me dancing. It's my favorite way to unwind and let go

                            happy, whether I'm practicing my favorite routines, dancing on stage with some of my closest
                            friends or just improvising to whatever music catches my ear.</p>

                            spare time. It's an excellent way for me to stay in shape, increase my strength and
                            flexibility, and improve my focus and self-discipline. Furthermore, the sense of
                            accomplishment I get from mastering a new technique or earning a new belt is extremely
                            rewarding and motivating.
