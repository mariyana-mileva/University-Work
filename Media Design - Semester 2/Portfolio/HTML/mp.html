                        The task to design a logo was a bit of a challenge for me as I was not sure how to approach it.
                        I ended up with the idea of combining the first letters of my first name and last name (Mariyana
                        Mileva).
                        I used black pink and white as for my color pallet as those are colors I like. I used linear
                        gradient effect (From pink to white) on the letters and radial
                        gradient (From black to darkpurple). For the creation of this logo I used Adobe Illustrator</p>

                        With this task I get the opportunity to design my own personal logo for the first time. I
                        learned the basics of working with Illustrator as well as various design tools and techniques. I
                        learned how to export my work correctly in different formats (PNG, PDF, SVG). I learned about
                        the different styles, for example: abstract logo, emblems, characters or just a text. Also
                        learned what colors, fonts and images should I use to improve the designs.

                        task. I started by creating the basic style for my portfolio. After that I slowly started adding
                        the pictures for each task to it. For some of the images I used Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop to
                        edit them in order to brighten or darken them. Some I edited with the goal of giving them
                        different effect or feeling.</p>

                        different concepts such as Depth of Field, Waterfall effect, Picture composition, etc.

                    <h2>Task of the assignment</h2>
                    <p class="description">We had to borrow a DLSR camera from ISSD with which we had to take pictures that fit certan photography techniques and rules. We had to create a PDF Document created using InDesign that contains our best photos of each type. Some of the photos we had to edit externaly.

                    </p>
                    <h2>What I Made</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        I created a 43 page document containing photos of each type with explanations plus one bonus task. I started by creating the basic style for my portfolio. After that I slowly started adding the pictures for each task to it. For some of the images I used Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop to edit them in order to brighten or darken them. Some I edited with the goal of giving them different effect or feeling.</p>

                    <h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        With this task I learned the basic techniques in the photography as well as how to edit my images externaly. I also learned how to work with the settings on the camera. How to apply different concepts such as Depth of Field, Waterfall effect, Picture composition, etc.
