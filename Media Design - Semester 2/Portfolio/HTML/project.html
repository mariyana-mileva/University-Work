                        actively listened to the client and tried to pay close attention to his Verbal as well as
                        nonverbal signals. We also asked questions allowing the client to freely express himself. After
                        the interview, we carefully analyzed the information gathered and used it to populate the four
                        parts of our empathy map - "Says", "Thinks", "Feels", "Does". In "Says" we documented statements
                        and quotes from the client. In "Thinks" we wrote down his assumptions and beliefs. In "Feels" we
                        captured the client's emotion state, while the "Does" part documented his actions and behavior.
                        Me alongside my group members worked together on this assignment.
